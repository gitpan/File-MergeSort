File/MergeSort version 1.10
===========================

POINTS TO NOTE

As of version 1.06, sorts are now performed lexicographically, so
File::MergeSort can now merge files with non-numeric merge keys.

As of version 1.10 (this version) IO::Zlib is no longer a prerequisite.
If IO::Zlib is installed, File::MergeSort will use it to handle
compressed input files.
If IO::Zlib is not installed and compressed files are specified as
input files, File::MergeSort will raise an exception.
If you do not need to process compressed files, there is no longer any
need install IO::Zlib to use File::MergeSort.
