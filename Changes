Revision history for Perl extension File::MergeSort.

1.23  Sat Jan 2 2010
    - Missed a test file from the MANIFEST, added.
    - It appears there is an issue with BEGIN{ use_ok() } with older
      versions of Test::More (such as the version shipped with RHEL
      and similar Linux distros) which I've been fighting
      with. Removing the problematic test rather than demand a newer
      Test::More for now.

1.22  Fri Jan 1 2010
    - Add ability to skip blank lines in the input files (RT #39969)
    - Improve tests slightly
    - Tweak Makefile.PL to include license

1.21  Thu Dec 24 2009
    - Fix a silly error in a test script that was causing
      Test::Pod::Coverage to be incorrectly utilised, breaking tests
      where that module was available.

1.20  Wed Dec 23 2009
    - After a rather long break, clean up code slightly.
    - This module no longer strips line endings from the lines read
      in.
    - Where the records to be read from input files have the same
      merge keys they will now be read in the order the files were
      supplied to the constructor - this should give a more
      predictable output. Thanks to Randy Osburn for the suggestion.

1.14  Sat Jan 28 2006
    - Fix problem with distribution, clearly v1.13 was unlucky ;-)

1.13  Fri Jan 27 2006
    - Fix broken example code.
    - Add another POD test.

1.12  Mon Apr 11 2005
    - Added POD coverage tests.
    - Minor documentation fixes.

1.11  Sun Feb 29 2004
    - The compressed test files were not included in v1.10, causing
      tests to fail if IO::Zlib was installed. This release fixes
      that oversight.

1.10  Sun Feb 29 2004
    - Small internal cleanups.
    - IO::Zlib is now optional, rather than a prerequisite.
      Compressed files are handled if IO::Zlib is installed. If you
      don't deal with compressed files, there is no longer any need
      to install IO::Zlib.
    - If compressed files are specified as input files and IO::Zlib
      is not installed an exception is raised.
    - Errors extracting merge key or opening files now cause an
      exception, rather than a warning.
    - Test suite fixed.

1.09  Sun Oct 19 2003
    - Commented out broken tests until they can be fixed.
    - Added Test::More as a prerequisite
    - Cleaned up stray Ctrl-M characters in files.
    - Tidied Authors and Copyright sections of documentation.
