Revision history for Perl extension File::MergeSort.

1.10  Sun Feb 29 01:45:00 2004
     - Small internal cleanups.
     - IO::Zlib is now optional, rather than a prerequisite.
       Compressed files are handled if IO::Zlib is installed. If you
       don't deal with compressed files, there is no longer any need
       to install IO::Zlib.
     - If compressed files are specified as input files and IO::Zlib
       is not installed an exception is raised.
     - Errors extracting merge key or opening files now cause an
       exception, rather than a warning.
     - Test suite fixed.
